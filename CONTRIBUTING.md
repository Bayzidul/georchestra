## Commits policy

* commits must be atomic: just one consistent change per commit
* when possible, refer to an issue in the commit message, for example adding
  `(see #xx)` at the end of the commit message, or `fixes ##` to close the issue.
* never commit environnement related changes

## Submitting a pull request

* keep pull requests as simple as possible.
